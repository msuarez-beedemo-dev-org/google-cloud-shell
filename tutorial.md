## What is Cloud Shell?

Before we jump in, let's briefly go over what Cloud Shell can do.

Cloud Shell is a personal hosted Virtual Machine which comes pre-loaded with developer tools for Google Cloud products. This interactive shell environment comes with a built-in code editor, persistent disk storage, and web preview functionality. To use command-line access alone, visit [console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell).

You can direct your users to Cloud Shell to help them quickly get started with your project; giving them an opportunity to step through a use case and familiarize themselves with your project's functionality.
